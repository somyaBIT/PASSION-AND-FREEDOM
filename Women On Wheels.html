      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>There is a strong history behind the role of bicycle in advancing women’s freedom, mobility, and position in
          society.

          #PFF repeated this history by organizing a WOW (Women On Wheels) ride which they consider as one of the most
          significant events of their journey. It holds a unique position for two reasons. First, the group never
          imagined the level of impact a simple activity like cycling can generate to bring a Social Change. Second,
          this event inspired the founder to evolve this cycling group Pedal for Fun into a Passion Platform which
          eventually grew as an NGO, Passion and Freedom Foundation. The founder says, “Running an NGO was my childhood
          dream, but I never imagined that the path to this dream will be realized through our small Cycling
          initiative.”

          The thought of organizing the WOW event came during a routine morning cycling ride shared between two friends
          and volunteers of #PFF Anil and Reshma who claim themselves to be Passionate Activists. They would generally
          talk about politics and social issues during their cycling regime. During one such ride, Reshma discussed her
          dream of designing a program which promotes Women Drivers and Gender Equality in the city. This way she wanted
          to help underprivileged women and women from the marginalized community get a respectable job as a driver who
          otherwise works as maids and cleaners. The only thing that was stopping Reshma to initiate this program was
          funding.

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>But who can stop Passionate people, who have already made up their minds? Both Anil and Reshma decided to
          raise fund by organizing a cycling ride only for Women. After all what else a cyclist could come up with while
          discussing such ideas during a bicycle ride. Reshma had already thought of the program name as Women On
          Wheels, and it sounded perfect for the event too. This was an AHA moment for both friends. They both believed
          that the universe had conspired to make these two long lost friends meet again through #PFF for this noble
          purpose. This realization was enough to start working on the nitty-gritty of the event that would help them to
          raise funds for the driving class fee for the first women driver under the program Women On Wheels.

        <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold lh-1">Best Award <br> according to Ngo.org</h1>
        <p class="lead">The event was concluded with an inspiring speech by PFF Co-Founder, Sonal and a thanking note by
          Gulnaz who was the first aspiring women driver to be funded for the driving class under the project Women On
          Wheels. Piyush Dungerwal, a lead singer from Oxyrock band, was kind enough to be part of this event and play
          some beautiful songs on Women Empowerment at the end to show his support to WOW.

          Reshma currently runs an NGO named DriverBen through which she supplies Women Drivers to Private and
          Government Organizations promoting Women safety. She finds WOW as a momentous event in laying the foundation
          of her successful venture.

          One important lesson, the success of WOW event taught the team was “To be passionate and take action and leave
          rest to the divine, and the magic will inevitably happen.” Th</p>
