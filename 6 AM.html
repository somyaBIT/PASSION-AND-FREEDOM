        <p class="lead">This is an inspirational story of how a group of friends planned to make their customary weekend
          into an adventurous one by executing their first cycling expedition which led to the foundation of their
          greatest inspiration.

          The founding member of #PFF, Anil Nair got a bicycle as a surprise gift from his beloved wife, Sonal Nair. His
          close friends Kumar, Avinash and Bhavin took advantage of the opportunity and came out with an impromptu plan.
          “Let’s bicycle to the nearest place, amidst the lap of nature, we have already experienced the thrill of
          adventure in our motorbikes earlier,” said one of the friend. “70 KM, It’s damn difficult.” grumbled another.
          “We have become humanoids. We have lost enthusiasm in our lives. Guys, let’s relive, rejoice & have sheer
          fun”, reclaims Anil.

          And so was the new adventuresome, energetic cycling group born in one of the casual meetings at night.

          Wait, wait inquisitiveness still continues. “What if we do not finish the journey? It’s not easy getting out
          of our beds so early & preparing ourselves for the tough day ahead. Not a single person from the group of 7
          ever did cycle so long or did endurance exercise to claim this 70 Km ride an easy chase. Thoughts still kept
          on crawling.

          It is rightly said “Your limitation – It’s your Imagination”. The sheer excitement of togetherness for the day
          ahead was enough to wipe off all the contrary thoughts. The journey started with absolute faith and a healthy
          mindset to conclude with a smirk. Requisite precautions & the sense of being together helped to fulfil the
          dream.

          Though it was not a race, none of the members tried to overhaul each other. Everyone was riding together and
          would wait at pre-decided points, to ensure no one is left behind. As they say ” It is not a Race, it is a
          Journey”.

          The trip is not complete until you face any challenges. One of the committee members had his bicycle broken in
          the midway of the countryside. But no problem is significant when you are together.

          Friends let’s hear the experience from the cheerleader’s mouth ” This cycling expedition was only possible due
          to togetherness, joy & motivation amongst the team members. If anyone of us were to do this alone, we would
          have given up in the midway. We learnt an important lesson that life is just like this cycling journey that we
          experienced, at times we cross through beautiful roads and enjoy all the beauty that life has to offer us, and
          there are times we have to ride through the rough patches giving us bumpy rides and making our journey
          difficult. But when we have friends and family around, the journey becomes easy and fulfilling” says Anil
          Nair.

          After reaching the destination, a group of friends emanated to become ONE TEAM who realised that how blessed
          they are to have loved ones around them enjoying an enduring lifestyle, but there are a lot of people around
          who are not privileged to enjoy the basic essentials of life. THE TEAM decided to raise the fund tenfold of
          whatever miles they rode and donate that amount for a good cause. They raised a small fund of Rs. 700(10 times
          of 70 KM) and gave their first cheque to QX Education foundation. The first seed of Giving planted while
          having fun through this platform.

          This day Anil realised, how we underestimate ourselves in every walk of life without understanding that we are
          far more capable of achieving things than we imagine. Most of the times it’s all about taking that 1st step.
