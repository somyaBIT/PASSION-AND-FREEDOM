        <p>Forthwith after the first ride, the founder realised that this journey is not just about pedalling, it’s a
          call for some higher purpose. The purpose to bring a social change by bringing positive transformation in
          someone’s life.

          This realisation within the hearts, initiated with the weekend rides, to spread the message of good health.
          With days, love for cycling kept increasing, and these humble two wheels brought some level of humbleness in
          all the messengers. It started with having a feeling of gratitude towards the surrounding and with this
          feeling the tribe organised a “Thanks Giving Ride” to thank the City Policeman who spend sleepless nights
          during the festive season to ensure that the citizens enjoy the festivities in a safe environment.

          And while these messengers kept organising short rides with different themes to promote Good Health and random
          act of Goodness, the seed of Giving that was planted during the first ride to Thol Lake started growing and
          turning into a strong desire to help those who are less privileged.

          And with no time this strong desire turned into a Passion. A Passion of spreading goodness in the society and
          with this newly discovered Passion, the messengers organised a short Santa Ride with a Christmas Theme where
          they dressed like a Santa Clause and pedalled to a nearby Orphanage run by Missionary of Charity, with the
          intention of spreading smiles and happiness. They even donated a small fund that they had raised through the
          participation in the ride.

        <p>The journey of the group continued with the highest motivation being encouraging and inspiring people to
          break their monotony and live an active lifestyle. Their Cycling Expedition stories started creating a buzz on
          Social Media, and it started showing a positive impact in their network with near and dear ones showing a keen
          interest in joining the group and be a part of this Noble Act of bringing positivity in people and society at
          large.

          As the tribe grew, they initially named the group as PFC (Pedal for Cause), as the group always has a social
          cause associated with their cycling journey. However one more thought stuck the minds, the messengers did not
          prefer to be looked upon as social workers on bicycles rather be known as fun loving people who want to spread
          positivity on their humble two wheels.

          Hence it was renamed as #PFF (Pedal for Fun). And the new chapter unfolds here.

          Amidst the new name, the group started organising different fun rides with different social themes to create
          Positive Social Impact.

          Bicycle known as an exercising or a fun tool had turned into a message of Social Change. And this led to the
          beginning of one of the most significant and most impactful events “WOW”.
